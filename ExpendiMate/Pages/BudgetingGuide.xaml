                FontAttributes="Bold"/>

            <Label Text="The 50/30/20 rule has gained significant popularity over the past two decades. According to Christensen, “It proposes that you spend 50% of your income on necessities like housing, transportation, cell phone, and utilities, allocate 30% for leisure activities like dining out, recreation, or travel, and save and invest the remaining 20%.”"

            <Label Text="The advantage of this method is its simplicity and ease of learning, not to mention it doesn’t require you to track every single purchase or expense! With that said, it doesn’t consider your personal circumstances so it may not be suitable for all situations. (For instance, if you reside in an area with high living costs, adhering to the 50% rule might be impractical.)"

            <Label Text="Similar to the 50/30/20 rule, this rule provides a flexible budgeting structure. The distribution for this budgeting strategy is: 70% for wants and needs, 20% for savings and investments, and 10% for debt repayments or donations"

                FontAttributes="Bold"/>

            <Label Text="A zero-based budget aims to make your income minus your expenses equal to zero. This means you allocate all your monthly income — initially, to your essentials, and then, to your desires and financial objectives. If you end up with an unspent $300 at the end of the month under this strategy, you’d allocate that money to savings, make an additional loan payment, or utilize it in some other way."

                LineHeight="1.3"/>

            <Label Text="The benefit of a zero-balance budget is that it accounts for every dollar, ensuring you maximize your earnings. The main disadvantage is that it’s time-consuming. Keeping track of each expense and every dollar you earn can be exhausting. It’s also challenging to implement with unpredictable incomes (you can’t predict how much you can allocate for each expense)."

            <Label Text="The pay yourself first strategy begins with your financial goals and works backward. For example, if you want to allocate $500 towards your mortgage and $500 into savings each month, you’d start by subtracting that $1,000 from your monthly net pay (for instance, $4,000 - $1,000), and then use that amount ($3,000) for your monthly bills and expenses."

            <Label Text="The envelope system is a monthly budgeting method devised by financial author Dave Ramsey. It involves placing cash into individual envelopes for each expense or category of expenses (e.g., housing, utilities, food, and entertainment). You then withdraw cash from the envelopes as costs occur during the month."

                LineHeight="1.3"/>

            <Label Text="If you deplete the money in an envelope, it indicates you overspent or need to allocate more to that category. If you have a significant amount left over, you can adjust the budget for the next month and allocate those funds elsewhere."

            <Label Text="The advantage of this method is that it’s visual and tangible, making it easy to comprehend your budget and how you can enhance it. Unfortunately, it’s also time-consuming, and cash isn’t always accepted — particularly in today’s digital economy."

            <Label Text="“The crux is to recognize your spending patterns and ensure they align with your spending priorities,” says Christensen. “For instance, if you’re spending $50 a week on soft drinks, but you’d prefer to prioritize buying a new gaming console, then it’s time to alter your soft-drink purchasing habits.”"

            <Label Text="While you can certainly manually monitor your budget, Christensen suggests using a budgeting app that links to your bank account, as these can simplify the process. For instance, ExpendiMate is an app that assists you in creating a budget, negotiating your bills, and reducing your spending — and it offers a free plan."
